# Deep Learning on Fashion MNIST Dataset

This project has built, compiled and trained a sequential neural network with keras using four powerful optimizers. (Stochastic Gradient Descent, Momentum, RMSP and Adam) The architecture of the neural network is not altered and the performance of these four optimizers can be compared with classification reports and learning curves availabe in figures directory.
